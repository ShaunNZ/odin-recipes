        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're expecting company for brunch, cook up this recipe for gourmet avocado toast with crumbled crispy pancetta and poached egg on rye.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice pancetta, diced</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 slice prosciutto</li>
            <li>1 slice rye bread, toasted</li>
            <li>1/2 ripe avocado, diced, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place pancetta in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and keep the water at a gentle simmer. 
            <li>Crack egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into the simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water. Cook until egg white is firm and the yolk thickens, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Remove the egg from the water with a slotted spoon and dab on a paper towel to remove excess water.</li>
            <li>Place prosciutto on the toast. Spread a generous layer of avocado on top; season with salt and pepper. Add pancetta; top with the poached egg.</li>
        </ol>
